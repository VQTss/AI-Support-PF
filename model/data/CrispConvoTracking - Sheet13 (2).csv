Operator: Some styles will not be applied correctly to the editor because of some conflicts and the editor has already selected the style.. Let me try another way. Operator: As I explained above, you are not selecting the font on the editor so it cannot load even though you have enabled the theme styling option.. And this font is not part of Google Fonts (font available on PageFly). So font weight cannot be loaded in the editor.. So in this case we can just add the CSS code in custom CSS so that it can load the font weight on the editor.. Operator: I'm very sorry for the inconvenience, I have removed the previous codes. Drake is off today. about this issue, I'm still discussing it with the dev team.. I will discuss this matter with Drake again..
